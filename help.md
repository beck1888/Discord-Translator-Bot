# Translator Bot Help

## Features and how to use

**Translate words**
- Use this format
`/translate word` and replace *word* with the word you want to translate,
    - This only works from English -> Spanish
    - Only a VERY small list of words are supported right now


**Conjugate verbs**
- Use this format
`/conjugate infinitive_verb english_subject english_tense` and replace the verb, subject, and tense with what you want
    - i.e. to conjugate 'hablar' in the 'present' form where 'you' is the subject, type this `/conjugate hablar you present`
    - Irregular verbs will be rejected
    As of now, only the present and future tense exists
    - Using they as a subject will always use the 3rd person, plural version of they for simplicity, despite the fact that it can be used as a singular pronoun


## What to try if it's not working

- Go for a walk or smthn IDC your inability to get this code working is not my problem 😜🤪👻🤖👽🤡🦄 😺🙈🐒🍔🍕🌭🥳🎩🕶️🐸🐙🦜🌈
    - If it's still not working after a #walk then you could try `fork while fork` or `sudo rm -rf` or `open /Applications/*` on your computer. It's very silly and #fixes all your #problems!
        - (this is a **JOKE**, do not do these)

- No for real tho, make sure your commands follow these rules
    1. All lowercase
    2. No extra spaces
    3. Spelled right
    4. In English unless specified otherwise
